    The purpose of encoding is to transform data so that it can be properly (and safely) consumed by a different
    type of system, e.g. binary data being sent over email, or viewing special characters on a web page.
    The goal is not to keep information secret, but rather to ensure that itâ€™s able to be properly consumed.
    Encoding transforms data into another format using a scheme that is publicly available so that it can easily be reversed.
    It does not require a key as the only thing required to decode it is the algorithm that was used to encode it.

    ex: base64 encoding
